Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in the film industry has been shaped by societal movements, industry changes, and global trends. Despite these developments, the industry remains male-dominated, and women continue to be significantly underrepresented in the filmmaking workforce. Problem. Women directors remain significantly underrepresented in the film industry, particularly in mainstream, high-budget productions. Our Goal. To discover trends in the role of female directors in cinema by analyzing their activity across different countries and examining movie databases for specific periods of study.

1,https://baizhankyzy.github.io/female-directors/,text,conclusion,,,,"Conclusion. The United States has the highest representation of women directors, while a significant number of countries—particularly in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia—still show minimal female representation. This disparity is also reflected in the availability of data and research. While the United States and European countries benefit from more accessible data and well-documented research, information from Asian and African countries remains limited. Also factors such as cultural barriers, lack of funding, and limited access to filmmaking education likely contribute to the low representation of female directors in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. Documentaries became notably popular in 2016, likely due to their lower production costs and structural accessibility, making them a favorable genre for female filmmakers.Analyzing this year alongside 2015 and 2017 revealed a growing trend in independent filmmaking and documentary production, indicating that female directors are finding their voice and opportunities in these areas. This trend indicates a significant shift toward alternative genres and non-mainstream film production. Both nominations and awards for female directors have shown consistent growth, with significant increases after 2010. However, nominations still far exceed awards, reflecting the ongoing struggle for women directors to convert recognition into wins. Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in feature films has been influenced by societal movements, industry shifts, and global trends. While some progress has been made, representation varies significantly by year and country.Documantary cinema often provides more opportunities for women compared to blockbuster productions, highlighting barriers in mainstream filmmaking. Examining global trends, including the rise of women directors in certain countries and their correlation with industry characteristics, sheds light on systemic challenges and opportunities for greater gender equity in the film industry.",,,,,,,,0,

2,https://nicoleliggeri.github.io/Italy-in-Magazienes/,text,introduction,,,,"Starting from the Enlightenment, periodical publications have played a decisive role in the development of European culture, giving rise to a phenomenon that has reached such proportions and importance that the 20th century has been called the ""century of magazines"". In the early decades of the twentieth century, literary magazines reflected the spirit of an era, one in which the figure of the young intellectual, engaged and militant, who believed they could put their culture and art at the service of the country, spread across Italy. Concurrently with the crisis of positivism and the rise of new idealism, magazines became the medium for intervening in the present and accelerating the movement of the world, overlaying it with the needs for individual ""vitality,"" and the aspiration for intense ideal and spiritual values. The culture of the new generations (roughly those born from 1880 onwards) appeared dominated by a strong critical tension that looked at the present, aiming to transform and overturn its characteristics. Criticism and essays came to the fore, seeking to measure themselves against the situation, opportunities, and trends of the present: a form of criticism that often did not settle for well-defined and limited objects, but aimed to suggest ideal perspectives and choices, ranging between ideology, politics, and philosophy, giving voice to the most complex dilemmas of the conscience. Ideology, criticism, and politics became closely intertwined: and the same reflection on literature became part of an intellectual battle in which ideas, forms, and projects seemed to move in a crowded and turbulent scene, with the actors being recognized by their roles filled with ideal strength, and by the tension that always animated their insights.",,,,,,,,0,

Those who wrote and read were educated Italians, wealthier than the average. The country’s elite was therefore concentrated in the North. In the first thirty years of the century, alongside Milan, Florence stood out as an important cultural hub, open in various directions. From the experience of Voce, continuing with internal opposition to fascism, realist literature, and engagement with European experiences. Rome, too, was another major center of cultural life. It’s essential to mention La Ronda, an expression of a desire for literary and ideological order.

2,https://nicoleliggeri.github.io/Italy-in-Magazienes/,chart section,,bar,,,"While in the early part of the century, foreign influences were scarce in Italian magazines, post-war Italian culture seemed to establish new relationships and contacts with foreign literatures. The most widespread culture in Italy was French. In the French culture of the 1940s and 1950s, existentialism was in the spotlight, with a lively interweaving of philosophy, politics, and literature (think of Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus). In France, a new form of novel, the nouveau roman, emerged, which rejected the centrality of the human figure, as did the theatre of the absurd, which also found great success in Italy. Finally, structuralism arrived from France through the fascinating works of Roland Barthes. In the 1950s, the resonances of the theater and narrative from England, particularly those of the angry men, reverberated through Italy. By the 1960s, American literature introduced fresh inspirations that explored destructive relationships with existence and the world. This thematic shift proved pivotal for the events of 1968, especially through the works of the Beat Generation authors. German culture played a crucial role in shaping intellectual discourse, offering significant insights, particularly through a Marxist lens.

This comprehensive examination has illuminated significant patterns and disparities that are essential for fostering a more inclusive and accessible cultural environment. Distribution of Cultural Institutions: The project's findings reveal a clear concentration of libraries, archives, and museums in major urban centers and historically significant regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto, Tuscany, and Lazio. This clustering reflects the economic and cultural prominence of these areas. However, the analysis also highlights a substantial presence of cultural institutions in smaller towns and rural areas, which ensures that cultural engagement extends beyond metropolitan centers. Despite this widespread distribution, certain regions, particularly in remote or less populated areas, exhibit lower concentrations of these vital institutions. This uneven distribution indicates a need for targeted efforts to improve cultural access in underserved regions. Enhancing the presence of cultural institutions in these areas could contribute to a more equitable cultural landscape across the country. Library Usage Patterns: The detailed analysis of library loans reveals significant variations in library usage based on region, demographic groups, and urban classification. Urban areas generally demonstrate higher library loan rates compared to rural regions, suggesting that population density and urbanization significantly impact library service utilization. Additionally, demographic factors play a crucial role in library usage patterns. Understanding these variations is essential for optimizing library services and ensuring that they meet the diverse needs of different communities. The data suggests that libraries in urban areas are more frequently used, while rural areas may require additional support to boost library engagement. Tailoring library services to address these regional and demographic differences can help ensure more effective and equitable resource distribution. Regional Reading Habits: The examination of reading habits across various regions of Italy provides valuable insights into how reading behaviors differ geographically. The data highlights several key metrics, such as the percentage of individuals reading one to three books versus twelve or more books, and preferences for printed versus digital formats. These insights reveal diverse reading engagement levels and format preferences across different regions. For instance, some regions may show a higher percentage of avid readers, while others may have a more moderate reading engagement. Additionally, the preference for printed versus digital books varies, reflecting broader trends in reading habits. Understanding these regional differences is crucial for developing targeted reading initiatives and promoting reading culture effectively. Tailored programs that address specific regional needs and preferences can help foster a stronger reading culture and encourage greater literary engagement.

A Focus on the Power Divide"". «The concept that women and men have equal conditions, treatment and opportunities for realizing their full potential, human rights and dignity, and for contributing to (and benefitting from) economic, social, cultural and political development. Gender equality is, therefore, the equal valuing by society of the similarities and the differences of men and women, and the roles they play. It is based on women and men being full partners in the home, opportunities will not depend on whether they are born male or female. Gender equality implies that the interests, needs and priorities of both women and men and girls Gender equality is a matter of human rights and - is considered a precondition for, and indicator of, sustainable people-centred development. » (Glossary of Terms and Concepts — UNICEF.) Although this concept may seem self-evident, gender equality is still a goal to be achieved. What needs to be changed is an entrenched social system, which is is why gender equality needs constant effort to stop being an issue. Since 2013 the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) draws up an annual report regarding progress and setbacks of women’s role in society. In 2022, Italy ranks 14th in the general index with a score of 65.0. The best score regards Health: 89.0, the worst one concerns Power, with a score of 56.9. This latter calculates the political, social, and economic spheres. Although all domains taken in consideration by the EIGE are crucial, we decided to analyze the worst one: Power.

The horizontal bar chart provides a detailed breakdown of the representation of male and female deputies in the Italian Chamber of Deputies throughout various legislative terms. Examining the data reveals interesting patterns and disparities in gender representation within the institution. In the earlier legislatures, such as the Costituente and Legislature I, the number of female deputies was relatively low, with 21 and 45 representatives respectively. Over time, the numbers fluctuated, but there was a general upward trend in female representation. Notably, the Legislature XVIII saw the highest number of female deputies with 240 representatives, while the XIX Legislature had 129. The widest gender gap was observed in Legislature XVII, where there where 466 male members and only 206 female members. To gain a better understanding of the gender disparities, it is helpful to also calculate the percentages of some significant data. For instance, the Legislature XVII, records the highest gender inbalance, with 69.35% of male presence, and 30,65% of female. The highest percentage of female representation in the chart is found in the XVIII Legislature, where out of a total of 660 deputies, women represented approximately 36.36% of the representatives. On the other hand, the lowest percentage is observed in the Costituente, with women comprising around 3.62% of the 581 deputies. While progress has been made in some legislatures, there are instances where female representation remains significantly low. In summary, the data presented in the chart demonstrates a significant increase in female representation from Legislature I to Legislature XVIII.

The geographical distribution of male and female deputies in the Italian Chamber of Deputies is a key aspect to consider in assessing regional representation within the institution. This question aims to explore the regional origins of deputies and investigate potential correlations between geographical distribution and gender representation. The hypothesis posits that there may be a higher concentration of deputies coming from the northern regions of Italy, due to the sizable socio-economic development. The choropleth map presents a visual representation of the data, allowing us to compare and contrast the number of male and female deputies in each region. Puglia: it has a high number of male deputies, with 369 representatives. However, the number of female deputies is considerably lower at 12, representing approximately 3.15% of the total. Lazio: it has a comparatively high number of male deputies, with 438 representatives. In terms of female representation, Lazio fares better with 91 deputies, accounting for approximately 17.18% of the total, the highest percentage for female provenance. Examining the remaining regions, we observe varying levels of gender representation. Some regions, such as Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Basilicata, have relatively low overall representation, both for male and female deputies. Other regions, like Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, have a more balanced representation, with approximately 10.60% and 9.12% of deputies being female, respectively. Smaller representation is recorded in Valle d'Aosta (14 male, 1 female) and in Molise (40 male, 2 female); this specific result is surely also due to the demography of the two regions, that are the smallest and less crowded in Italy. Upon examining the data, several observations can be made: Lombardia: it has the highest number of male deputies, with 657 representatives. In fact, Lombardy is the biggest and most populated region in Italy. Despite this, the number of women is much lower than men, namely 62. Hence, the female presence is approximately 8.6% and 91.4% male presence. This makes Lombardy third in terms of female provenance after Lazio and Tuscany, whose population is approximatively 1/2 and 1/3 of Lombardy population. This latter discrepancy may be attributed to various factors, however it devalues the starting hypothesis. Other leading regions for male presence are Campania counting 544 and Sicilia counting 495. Correspondingly, 47 and 35 female deputies. North, center, south. In conclusion, when the regions are not considered singularly, but clusterd by northern, central, and southern regions of Italy, we can observe variations in the percentages of female deputies. In the North,(Piemonte, Lombardia, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Liguria, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Valle d'Aosta) approximately 34.41% of the deputies are female, indicating a relatively higher representation compared to the Central and South regions. The Central regions (Toscana, Marche, Umbria, Lazio) have approximately 27.02% female deputies, while the South regions (Campania, Abruzzo, Puglia, Sicilia, Calabria, Basilicata, Sardegna, Molise) has the lowest representation at approximately 8.32%.",Geographical Distribution of Male and Female Deputies.

The third research question focuses on the educational background of deputies, both male and female, and seeks to determine the proportion of representatives who hold a higher education degree. By examining the data, we can gain insights into the educational qualifications of deputies across different legislatures and explore any disparities between genders. It is hypothesized that a significant proportion of female deputies will possess higher education degrees due to gender disparities in society, where women may need to demonstrate greater qualifications compared to their male counterparts. This is in line with the notion that women often face higher scrutiny and expectations in professional settings, leading them to pursue higher levels of education to prove their competence and eligibility for political positions. Additionally, there is a general expectation that earlier legislative periods may have a lower number of deputies with higher education degrees compared to more recent legislatures. This hypothesis stems from historical context, as educational attainment was relatively lower in the past century compared to recent times, where higher education has become more accessible. In our analysis of male representatives, we observe distinct patterns in their educational qualifications across various legislatures. On average, male deputies have a solid representation of higher education degrees, with an average percentage of approximately 67%. The mode, which represents the most frequent value, stands at 69%, and the lowest recorded percentage of male deputies holding higher education degrees is 63%, notably occurring during the XVI and XVII legislatures. These legislatures, with a lower representation of male deputies with higher education degrees, offer insights into the complexities of educational attainment among male representatives in specific historical contexts. Interestingly, these findings challenge our initial hypothesis that earlier legislative periods may have a lower number of deputies with higher education degrees compared to more recent legislatures. However, the presence of the legislature I, with the highest percentage of male deputies holding higher education degrees, showcases the variability in educational qualifications over different legislative periods. This indicates that historical context alone may not be the sole determinant of educational trends among male representatives. Education analysis: Female data. Turning our attention to female representatives and considering the provided data, we uncover intriguing trends in their educational backgrounds across various legislative periods. On average, female deputies exhibit a unique profile, with an average percentage of approximately 56% holding higher education degrees. Delving into the specifics, we find variations in the data. The mode, representing the most frequently occurring value, consistently stands at 55% or 56%, indicating that these percentages are frequently observed across different legislatures. This suggests a recurring trend in educational qualifications among female representatives over time. Notably, there are instances of legislative periods where the educational profile of female deputies diverges. For instance, during the '11' legislature, we observe a significant increase, with 70% of female representatives holding higher education degrees. This suggests a potential turning point or a unique context in that legislative era. Additionally, the XIV legislature stands out as an exception with 73% of female deputies holding higher education degrees, signifying a peak in educational qualifications during that specific period. While examining the educational qualifications of female representatives, we explore the hypothesis that a significant proportion of female deputies would possess higher education degrees due to societal gender disparities. This hypothesis was rooted in the idea that women often face greater scrutiny and expectations in professional settings. However, the data analysis reveals a more complex picture. On average, female deputies exhibit an educational profile where approximately 56% hold higher education degrees. While this percentage indicates a substantial presence of educated female representatives, it falls short of confirming the hypothesis of a 'significant' proportion. Moreover, certain legislative periods show lower percentages of female deputies with higher education degrees, such as the XIV and XV legislatures. These instances challenge the notion that a uniform trend of higher educational attainment among female representatives exists across all legislative eras. In essence, the data suggests that while gender disparities persist in society, the impact on the educational qualifications of female deputies in the political arena is multifaceted. While some female representatives do possess higher education degrees, indicating their commitment to demonstrating qualifications, the presence of variability in educational profiles across different legislative periods underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of these dynamics. Societal expectations and gender disparities may play a role, but they interact with other complex factors influencing the educational attainment of female political representatives.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the educational backgrounds of deputies, it would be beneficial to further analyze the data in conjunction with additional factors such as the parties they belong to or their roles within the Chamber of Deputies. This would provide deeper insights into the relationship between educational qualifications and political representation, shedding light on potential barriers or biases that may affect access to political positions. In conclusion, the provided data offers detailed insights into the educational profiles of male and female deputies in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, legislature by legislature. While there are variations across different legislatures, there is an overall positive trend in the number of graduates among both genders. By addressing any existing disparities and promoting equal access to education, Italy can further enhance the representation of highly educated individuals within its political landscape. in educational qualifications within both genders across different legislatures.

How many women are represented in each political party, and is political alignment a significant factor in this regard? In our ongoing exploration of the Italian political landscape, the fourth research question delves into the gender composition of political parties and their alignment within the broader spectrum. Understanding the relationship between political alignment and gender representation can shed light on the dynamics of gender inclusivity within the Italian political landscape. The initial hypothesis is that parties leaning towards the left side of the political spectrum, which are historically characterized as less conservative and more progressive, are likely to have a higher representation of women. This hypothesis is grounded in the idea that parties with a more progressive orientation may prioritize gender inclusivity and women's rights, leading to a greater participation of women in their ranks. It is within this context that we embark on our analysis, aiming to uncover patterns, trends, and disparities that contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the state of gender equality in Italian politics. An Overview ordered of Parties by Female Representation. Trasversalismo (Transversalism): Leading with 41% female representation, ""MOVIMENTO 5 STELLE"" reflects a commitment to gender diversity. What is important to point out is that, in our data-base the MS5 party is the only one with transversalism alignment. Sinistra (Left): Parties in this category exhibit an average of 21% female representation. ""LIBERI E UGUALI"" demonstrates 30% female representation, indicating a strong presence of women in left-wing politics. Centro-destra (Center-right): These parties have an average of 18% female representation. ""CORAGGIO ITALIA"" leads with 35% female participation, reflecting a noteworthy effort to engage women in center-right politics. Estrema sinistra (Extreme Left): Parties on the extreme left exhibit an average of 16% female representation. ""PARTITO COMUNISTA ITALIANO"" leads with 15% female participation, suggesting a commitment to gender diversity in the far-left political spectrum. Centro-sinistra (Center-left): These parties have an average of 14.2% female representation. ""PARTITO DEMOCRATICO"" ranks highest with 34% female participation, indicating a substantial presence of women in center-left politics. Centro (Center): Parties in the center exhibit an average of 11.71% female representation. ""ITALIA DEI VALORI"" showcases 8% female participation, while ""SCELTA CIVICA"" follows with 19%, indicating a diverse range of female engagement within centrist parties. Destra (Right): Right-wing parties have an average of 9.78% female representation. ""FRATELLI D'ITALIA"" stands out with 29% female participation, showcasing a notable effort to involve women in right-wing politics. Estrema destra (Extreme Right): ""MOVIMENTO SOCIALE ITALIANO - DESTRA NAZIONALE"" ranks highest in this category with 3% female representation, indicating a significant gender disparity within extreme right-wing movements.

The fifth research question explores the roles held by male and female deputies within the Chamber of Deputies, aiming to identify potential disparities in the distributionof influential or leadership positions. Analyzing the data, we can observe the following trends: Male Deputies: across the legislatures, male deputies have held a diverse range of roles within the Chamber of Deputies. These roles include Vice President, President, Secretary, Questore, Capogruppo (group leader). Notably, male deputies have consistently occupied influential positions. For example, in the 19th legislature, there were 215 male Capogruppo, accounting for approximately 83.33% of the total Capogruppo positions. Female Deputies: The data indicates that female deputies have also been appointed to various roles within the Chamber of Deputies, albeit with fewer representatives. These roles include Vice President, President, Secretary, Questore, and Capogruppo. While the numbers of female deputies in leadership positions are lower compared to male deputies, there has been progress over time. In the 19th legislature, there were 47 female Capogruppo, constituting approximately 16.67% of the total Capogruppo positions. Comparative Analysis: Comparing the roles held by male and female deputies, it is evident that there is a gender disparity in terms of representation in influential positions. Male deputies consistently outnumber female deputies in leadership roles across all legislatures. However, it is important to note the positive trend of increased female representation over time. Overall, the data highlights the need to continue promoting gender equality in terms of leadership positions within the Chamber of Deputies. While progress has been made in increasing female representation, there is still work to be done to ensure a more balanced and inclusive distribution of influential roles. In conclusion, the data demonstrates the distribution of roles held by male and female deputies in the Italian Chamber of Deputies.

The sixth research question focuses on the gender distribution of prime ministers in Italy, highlighting the concept of the ""glass ceiling"" theory. It aims to determine the number of female prime ministers compared to their male counterparts, shedding light on the gender representation at the highest level of political leadership. Analyzing the provided data, it becomes evident that there has been a significant disparity in terms of gender representation among prime ministers in Italy, supporting the notion of a glass ceiling effect. Out of the listed prime ministers, only one, Giorgia Meloni, is female. This data point stands out prominently in the pie chart representation, emphasizing the challenges women face in breaking through barriers to reach top political positions. The overwhelming majority of prime ministers in Italy have been male, reflecting a historical trend and the persistence of gender inequality in leadership roles. This underrepresentation of women in the highest political office aligns with the glass ceiling theory, which suggests that invisible barriers, such as societal norms, stereotypes, and structural obstacles, impede women's progress and limit their access to positions of power. The presence of only one female prime minister further highlights the need for concerted efforts to dismantle the barriers that hinder women's advancement in politics. It requires creating inclusive environments, addressing gender biases, and implementing policies that promote equal opportunities for women to reach top leadership positions. This data underscores the importance of actively supporting and empowering women in politics, challenging traditional norms and structures, and fostering a more inclusive and diverse political landscape.

The seventh research question pertains focuses on the allocation of ministerial positions to women across different governments. This analysis seeks to investigate whether women tend to be relegated to less influential ministries or those traditionally associated with ""feminine"" concerns, such as education and social affairs. By examining a comprehensive dataset spanning various legislatures and governments, this study aims to shed light on potential patterns and trends in the allocation of ministerial roles. The dataset encompasses ministerial appointments in Italian governments from different eras, ranging from early to contemporary administrations. By systematically reviewing this data, intriguing observations emerge. While Italy has made strides in appointing women to ministerial roles, a closer look raises questions about the distribution of portfolios. There is a discernible trend wherein women are often appointed to ministries related to social issues, education, and family matters. These ministries, while crucial, have historically been perceived as less powerful and influential compared to economic, foreign affairs, and defense portfolios. This analysis also brings to light a disheartening historical reality: women ministers have only appeared in Italian governments from the 7th legislature onwards, with an absence of female representation in the legislatures preceding it. This underscores the urgency of addressing longstanding gender disparities in ministerial appointments and promoting a more inclusive political landscape. One example from the dataset illustrates this trend. In several instances, women have been appointed as Ministers for Education, Public Instruction, or Family Affairs. While these roles hold significant importance, they appear to align with traditional gender roles and might reinforce stereotypical associations. Furthermore, a concentration of women in ministries that are not traditionally considered as wielding substantial political power might indicate a deeper systemic issue. This analysis, however, does not solely dwell on disparities. It also acknowledges the progress made over the years. Recent governments have witnessed women occupying higher-profile ministerial roles, such as Foreign Affairs, Defense, and . These instances point toward a gradual shift in breaking gender stereotypes and recognizing women's capabilities across a broader spectrum of ministerial domains. In conclusion, the examination of ministerial appointments in Italian governments underscores the need for continued efforts towards achieving gender parity in political leadership. An in-depth analysis of ministerial appointments in Italy reveals a striking gender disparity, especially when considering the importance of the ministries assigned to women. The data provided highlights that, historically, few women have been entrusted with key ministerial roles in the most critical government departments. Let us examine the data extracted from the table, considering the ministries deemed most significant, specifically those with portfolios: Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Federica Mogherini is the sole woman who held this significant role, and she did so in the 17th legislature. This ministry plays a pivotal role in shaping Italy's foreign policy and international relations. Ministry of the Interior. Luciana Lamorgese held this position in the 18th legislature, representing a recent and notable exception. The Ministry of the Interior is crucial for domestic security and law enforcement, making it one of the most important in the government. Ministry of Justice. Only one woman, Anna Maria Cancellieri, has served as Minister of Justice, and this was in the 16th legislature. This ministry is responsible for the legal system and judiciary, making it a highly significant role. Ministry of Defense. Roberta Pinotti, serving in the 17th legislature, is the lone female minister to hold this vital position. The Ministry of Defense oversees the country's military and national security. Ministry of Economy and Finance. No woman has been appointed to lead this ministry in the provided data. Given its role in managing the country's finances and economic policies, it is undeniably one of the most important. Ministry of Economic Development. While Teresa Bellanova served in the 17th legislature as Vice Minister of Economic Development, no woman is listed as the head of this ministry. This department plays a central role in economic growth and industrial policy. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Teresa Bellanova's appointment as Minister in the 18th legislature stands out as a notable exception. Agriculture and forestry are critical for the country's food security and environmental policies. Ministry of the Environment and Land Protection. Stefania Prestigiacomo led this ministry in the 16th legislature. It's responsible for environmental protection and conservation, an issue of global significance. Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. Paola De Micheli, in the 18th legislature, is the only woman mentioned. This ministry oversees Italy's infrastructure development, including transportation networks. Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Policies. Livia Turco served as Minister of Health in the 13th legislature, representing the only woman mentioned in these critical areas. These ministries deal with public health, labor rights, and social welfare. Ministry of Education, Universities, and Research. Letizia Moratti and Lucia Azzolina are the only women listed here. Education and research are vital for a nation's intellectual and economic development. Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities.

Among the 27 EU countries, there are 7 states that have both legislative and voluntary quotas -- 3 with only legislative quotas in effect, 13 with only voluntary quotas, and 5 where no quota system has been implemented to date.

This progress coincides with the period during which many EU countries implemented gender quota laws. While the path to full gender equality is still long, this increase is a positive sign of the ongoing change. However, there are several pending issues to consider. Firstly, it's necessary to acknowledge that the quota system does not seem to have positively influenced women's access to key positions of legislative power.

In Italy, the Rosato Law, officially known as Law 165 of November 3, 2017, commonly referred to as Rosatellum bis or simply Rosatellum, governs the election of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Italian Republic. This electoral law incorporates measures to ensure gender representation, including the following three conditions: Each party or coalition cannot have more than 60% candidates of the same gender in single-member constituencies, which applies nationally for the Chamber and regionally for the Senate. Each party cannot have more than 60% top candidates of the same gender in the proportional part, again following national criteria for the Chamber and regional criteria for the Senate. Candidates in multi-member lists must be alternated by gender. If the criteria are not met, the affected lists are not admitted (Art. 1, comma 10 e). In addition to these quotas, political parties also implement voluntary quotas based on their own statutes and regulations. These are commitments made by parties to ensure equitable inclusion of women and men, both in electoral lists (as an extra effort beyond national law) and within party roles. In some cases, these are recommendations, while in others, they serve as requirements. Among the parties represented in parliament, the Democratic Party is the only one that has established voluntary quotas, requiring a 50% female presence in its electoral lists. Italy's Mixed Electoral System. In Italy, is used a mixed electoral system. 37% of seats are allocated through a majoritarian system, where the candidate with one more vote wins (single-member constituencies). Meanwhile, 63% of seats are distributed proportionally, based on the percentages of votes obtained by different parties (multi-member constituencies). In the 2018 elections for the Chamber of Deputies, 40% of candidates in each coalition's 232 single-member constituencies had to be women. There were also 63 multi-member constituencies, and electoral lists followed the proportional system. Navigating Gender Balance in Single-Member Constituencies. At the outset, gender quotas are consistently observed; however, the data indicates that the selection of male or female candidates in single-member constituencies is meticulously planned. This strategic consideration stems from the fact that party leaders, who often happen to be male, are the ones responsible for determining electoral lists. Consequently, male party leaders tend to favor male candidates, contributing to this strategic decision-making process.Parties are acutally aware of the specific areas where they will be competing, and considering that the electoral districts are relatively small in size, the strategy is, to facilitate male candidates for constituencies considered to be armoured; those in which victory is considered almost certain due to a historical issue (such as the so-called 'red regions' for the centre-left), the pool of voters and the inferior notoriety of the opponent are considered safe constituencies. On the other hand, for the more uncertain territories, with less likelihood of majority victory, a woman is nominated. The 2018 elected at the Camera dei deputati are male 150 (65%) and the woman are 82 (35%). Moreover, as for the runners-up, we see that there are 130 men, i.e. fewer than those who won, and 106 women, far more than those elected. Gender Dynamics in Multi-Member Constituencies and multiple nominations. For what concern the multi-nominal constituencies (63 in the chamber of deputies in 2018), the electoral law provides proportionality between the votes received by each party and the seats obtained as a result. As we have said, the lists are blocked, at least 40% of the candidates must be women, with mandatory gender alternation. For this reason, in contrast to the single-member, for the multi-nominal constituencies, the most uncertain constituencies will see a man as the leader. Sacrificing a female runner-up is a lower price to pay. On the other hand, in the most easily placed constituencies, female leaders multiply, so that the second candidates in the electoral list, a man, can also be elected. The issue becomes more intricate when it comes to multiple nominations. The law provides that all parties are entitled to nominate the same person in five multi-nominal constituencies and one single-nominal constituency. A manoeuvre that, on the one hand, opens up the possibility for small parties to hope for at least one seat, and on the other hand favours the strategies of those with more power. In fact, often the name of the same leading woman appears in the electoral lists of five (generally armoured) constituencies, the result? One woman will be elected and the others will be men, due to the system of gender alternation.",Gender Quotas and Electoral Strategies.

9,https://giorgimariachiara.github.io/COD/index.html,text,conclusion,,,,"Conclusions. Gender Balance in the Italian Chamber of Deputies. 1 How many deputies are there in the Chamber Of Deputies.The initial hypothesis that women are consistently underrepresented compared to men in every legislature is unequivocally confirmed. This disparity signifies a systemic issue within Italian politics. However, the unexpected decrease in female representation in the 19th legislature, despite the introduction of the Rosatellum Law in 2017, raises questions about the law's effectiveness in achieving gender balance. Further investigation into the implementation of this legislation is warranted to address this concerning trend. 2 What is the geographical distribution of male and female Deputies. The hypothesis posits that a higher concentration of deputies may come from the northern regions due to their socio-economic development. This hypothesis is confirmed if we consider this macro-level division (north, central, south), but it is important to point out that Lazio, located in the central part of Italy, exhibits the highest number of female deputies, which serves as an intriguing outlier in the regional analysis of gender representation. 3 What is the educational background of male and female deputies, and do historical trends play a role? Contrary to initial expectations, female deputies exhibit similar educational qualifications as their male counterparts. Furthermore, historical data does not support the hypothesis of a substantial gap in educational attainment between earlier and more recent legislative periods. These findings challenge the assumption that women must overcompensate with higher education to secure political positions, implying a more level playing field in recent years. 4 What is the representation of women in different political parties, and does political ideology influence this representation? The data validate the hypothesis that left-leaning parties exhibit a higher number of female deputies. This observation suggests that political ideology can significantly impact the representation of women in Italian politics. Further analysis of the policies and practices of these parties might provide insights into strategies that promote gender equality in political parties. 5 What are the gender disparities in the distribution of influential or leadership positions among deputies? The hypothesis that women hold fewer powerful positions in the Chamber of Deputies is corroborated, aligning with the glass ceiling theory. This observation underscores the persistent challenges faced by women in accessing influential roles in Italian politics. Addressing these disparities should be a priority to promote a more balanced political landscape. 6 What is the gender breakdown of Presidents of the Council, and does the glass ceiling concept apply here? The expected outcome of fewer female Presidents of the Council is affirmed, aligning with the glass ceiling theory. The fact that only one female, Meloni, currently holds this position highlights the ongoing gender disparity at the highest summits of Italian politics. This raises questions about the mechanisms and barriers preventing women from attaining the highest political offices. 7 What ministries have been assigned to women, and does this reflect traditional gender roles? The hypothesis that women are often assigned ministries associated with traditional gender roles or deemed less influential is upheld. Although these roles have significance, they perpetuate stereotypical associations and further underscore the unequal distribution of power and responsibility within the government. This calls for a reassessment of how ministries are allocated. 8 How effective has the Rosatellum Law been in achieving gender quotas in the Chamber of Deputies?The data validate the hypothesis that the 40% gender quota mandated by the Rosatellum Law is inadequately enforced, with few parliamentary groups meeting the required representation of women. This discrepancy points to a need for more stringent enforcement mechanisms and a reevaluation of how gender quotas are implemented, to ensure genuine progress toward gender equality in Italian politics. Women's presence in Italian politics is undeniable, but achieving gender parity remains a work in progress. Despite significant progress made over the years, an analysis of various aspects of female representation within the Chamber of Deputies reveals persistent disparities. These disparities, varying across regions, political parties, and roles, underscore the ongoing challenges women face. Notably, there is significant room for improvement, particularly in enhancing gender diversity in leadership positions. This situation reflects the concept of a 'glass ceiling,' emphasizing the enduring obstacles women encounter in reaching influential roles. Additionally, the underutilization of the 40% gender quota mandated by the Rosatellum Law underscores the need for more effective enforcement and implementation of policies aimed at achieving gender equality. In Italian politics, a steadfast commitment to fostering a more inclusive and equitable political landscape is paramount. This commitment extends beyond increasing the number of female deputies; it encompasses ensuring women's access to influential positions and roles traditionally held by men. This transformative approach not only celebrates the diversity and talents of the entire population but also creates a political arena that is genuinely representative and responsive. While substantial progress has been made, the path toward achieving authentic gender equality in Italian politics is ongoing and demands sustained dedication and effort.",,,,,,,,0,

The collection features unique photos of several paintings that no longer exist, making these images an invaluable testament. Impact on specific Categories. The collection's contributed to enrich the KHI collection with photos featuring Italian artists, with the Italian Baroque painter Guercino being prominently featured. Moreover, a high number of photos of paintings from Italian Renaissance was added to the Photothek's collection. The artworks in the collection are mainly located in Italy (in particular Rome and Florence), Germany, and Vienna. The greatest contribution was given with photos of several paintings from the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden. Bürkel's collection allowed to expand the set of photographs by German photographer Hanfstaengl. Further research. The project Bürkelens can serve as starting point for several research activities. It provides a basis for a more in-depth analysis on the figure of the art historian Ludwig von Bürkel, with the possibility to correlate his publications in relation to his photo collection. Another possibility is to integrate information about the remaining part of the collection and conduct further analysis on the data, documented in the inventory books, which was not included in the project due to its relatively limited scope. An interesting perspective could emerge from the comparison between Bürkel's collection and photographic collections of other art historians, such as the one available on ARTchives. This project could serve as a model for analyzing other collections held in the Photothek of the KHI. Lastly, the project provides insights to expand the development of methods for data extraction from the KHI database for future analyses. ",,,,,,,,0,

The factor that more clearly displays the female character as an erotic object of desire either for the other characters in the filmed story or for the viewer (audience) of such story, linking the concept of “male gaze” to that of scopophilia.

Specifically, we will examine the ten highest-grossing U.S. films for each decade from the 1940s to the 2010s.

The ""Partizione Antica"" of the Supino Art Photo Archival fund—belonging to the Biblioteca delle Arti dell'Alma Mater Studiorum Università di Bologna—is a special subfund that has always been valorized for its stunning photograph images and their documental importance for history of art. It has been catalogued in the '90s from the Archivio Storico of the University of Bologna, and their data are available in the online public access library catalogue, and, more recently, from the Federico Zeri Foundation catalogue in the specific scheda F (for photographs) and scheda OA (for works of art) Italian Ministry ICCD rules. Most of the photographs are handwritten annotated. But, who is their original collector? Despite the Partizione Antica has received a lot of attentions and has been studied, catalogued and digitized, the identity of its creator remains unknown. Here is a summary of the few known information: Timespan activity: XIXth century. Interested in: Ancient Art. Languages: native English, proficient in French, Italian and German.

SEE THE CRITICAL JOURNEY",,,,,,,,0,
16,https://manueleveggi.github.io/infoviz/,chart section,,timeline,text;image,click;link,"A travelling artwork and the art of connoisseurship. First appearance. The portrait first appeared on the art market in Rome in 1910. In this year it was published on the Catalogue of Sangiorgi, one the most important art galleries in Europe that put the painting on sale. The canvas was accompanied by an attribution to the Spanish painter El Greco, long active in Rome. Some of the most illustrious critics of the period (F. Mason Perkins, Ellis Waterhouse) agreed with this attribution in the following years. As by “El Greco” it was bought by George Blumental in 1914. Blumental donated the portrait to the MET in 1941. The debate. In 1944 Margaretta Salinger proposed to ascribe the painting to Jacopino del Conte. The young Federico Zeri, who devoted his dissertation to this artist, rose his doubts about this attribution. In 1949 he wrote a letter to the Metropolitan Museum stating that: “Inv. no. 41.100.05: The hypothesis about Jacopino del Conte is not acceptable, as it is not supported neither by comparisons with other artworks of his, nor by the date 1566. At this time Jacopino was doing totally different portraits, which are characterised by a very mechanical and arid style. In my opinion, the painting was not created by this Roman painter, rather by an artist who also knew the pictorial tradition of Northern Italy”. In the catalog about North Italian paintings at the MET, written by Zeri in the following years and published in 1986, he shifted his opinion and attributed the portrait to the Bolognese painter Bartolomeo Passerotti ""The composition is apparently derived from a model current in Rome, very likely by Jacopino del Conte, but the brushwork reflects Venetian technique around the middle of the century, especially that of the young Jacopo Tintoretto. The treatment of highlights, the thin layer of colors, and the general tone are quite typical of Passerotti, and the date is consistent with his work at that moment”. Recent opinions. In 1995, D. Stephen Pepper reoriented the discussion to suggest that the author came instead from among the so-called Studiolo artists, the group of painters that worked for Duke Francesco I de’ Medici in his private chamber in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence beginning in 1570. Of these, Pepper focused on Girolamo Macchietti (1535–1592). Privitera and Feinberg later demonstrated as visual connections are even closer with another painter of this circled, Mirabello Cavalori (Florence ?-1572). This latter appears to be the most authoritative attribution nowadays, even if some scholars have recently proposed the names of Maso da San Friano and, again, of Jacopino del Conte. The discovery of a copy of the painting in a private collection, bearing the castle of Magione in the background, made it possible to identify the character depicted, who is supposed to be Fra Jacopo Salviati, nephew of the Grand Prior of the Knights of Malta, born in 1537 and thus 29 in 1566.",,,,,,no,Metropolitan Museum of Art;Zeri Photo Archive Collection,1,timeline_rich

17,https://madrigalis.github.io/index,text,introduction,,,,"What is a madrigal? madrigal (noun) ˈma-dri-gəl A genre of musical composition, extremely popular in the 16th-17th century, especially in Italy and England, for voice ensemble or solo voice and instruments. Its distinguishing feature is word-painting (madrigalism): the expression, through the means of music, of the lyrics’ affects and meaning. This non-religious (secular) music form became so popular that composers from all over Europe contributed to it. Then, other musical genres evolved and surpassed the madrigal after the XVIIth century. However, it had a second life between 1800 and 1900, when new authors experimented with these compositions. It is nowadays a niche genre, appreciated by a group of Renaissance music lovers but mostly unknown to the wider public. Why Giving Voice To Madrigals? As lyrics by the most influential Italian poets were set to music and played at courts for people's entertainment during the 16th-17th centuries, we want to introduce users to madrigals through direct listening to some of the most famous songs, ""giving them a voice"" interpreted by the protagonists of some Renaissance paintings. As during Reinassence words’ meaning was amplified by the power of these musical compositions, Giving voice to Madrigals is an attempt to draw attention to this musical genre, nowadays nearly forgotten by the vast public, through a visual data journey.",,,,,,,,0,

In this rather brief time, he nevertheless brought the madrigal genre from its initial polyphonic asset to the avantgarde declamatory style, exploring new poems as source for inspiration, such as Guarini, Sannazaro and Tasso. The two most prolific madrigal publishers, i.e. the Gardano family and Bartholomeo Magni were anything but rivals? Indeed, they were tightly interconnected, as Diamante Gardano, Angelo’s daughter and heiress, married Bartholomeo: together, they led the business for the whole 17th century, in parallel publishing with either of the two dynasties’ names.

This musical genre was born in Italy and spread mostly from the Italian printing presses to reach the rest of Europe. The most important printing center was Venice, which produced 70% of the publications of that time. Among the publishers, the most prolific one for madrigals was Angelo Gardano. The most recurring themes for madrigals are love and death, as is the case in most lyrical compositions from Baroque music to nowadays. However, unlike in most classical operas, love wins over death! “Love” is the most used keyword, in 490 titles, while “Death” totals 54 entries. The beginning of the period started with a preference for 4 voices madrigals, which faded away in profit of more numerous voices (5 and 6). In the most prolific decade, from 1580 to 1589, composers chose to compose mostly for 5 voices, all equal (in the sense that no voice is the principal one and others merely accompaniment).",,,,,,,,0,

At the turn of the 20th century, photography had become the most accessible and popular medium for portraiture. Photography (from the Greek words phos, meaning “light”, and graphê meaning “drawing or writing”) which literally translates to ""drawing with ligth"", allowed for a more realistic and accurate depiction of what we see. As though photography freed artists from the burden of producing realistic depictions, many late-19th- and early-20th-century artists began to experiment with new ways to portray people on canvas. Many artists sought to represent the character and psychology of their sitters; similarly, when portraying themselves, they aimed at communicating something of their innermost selves. The attention for subjectivity and emotions paired with the eagerness to break with the tradition, typical of the late 19th century and the avant-garde movements, created the conditions for a radical transformation in the portraiture genre in modern art.",,,,,,,,0,

The invention of synthetic pigments and paint tubes during the Industrial Revolution allowed the Impressionists and succeeding generations of artists to paint outside of their studios and offered a greater range of colors at more competitive prices.

From Impressionism to Cubism and beyond, let's take a look at the colour palettes of portraits and self-portraits at the turn of the 19th and 20th century. Each palette shapes the aesthetic of some of the most well-known artistic movements in modern art. Throughout history, certain colors have maintained symbolic associations that are often reflected in art. Many artists have incorporated colour into their artwork to elicit certain emotions. For instance, Picasso's use of only blue hues to show depressing and disheartening themes from 1901 to 1904 and the use of red, pink, and orange hues to depict a happier and cheerful mood from 1904 to 1906 are good examples of how color affects emotion. Colours may evoke emotions that words cannot quite match. Depending on the viewer and where they are from, each hue has a positive and negative significance that can trigger a variety of reactions and emotions. RED - usually symbolizes power, passion, love, adventure, and energy; but can also symbolize anger, seduction, violence, and danger. YELLOW - is typically is a symbol of happiness, enlightenment, joy, positivity, and clarity. It can also symbolize being critical, judgmental, or cautious. ORANGE - is typically is a symbol of enthusiasm, fascination, creativity, determination, success, and stimulation. Its negative meaning can be abrasive and crass. GREEN - is a symbol of life, renewal, nature, growth, balance and harmony. It can also be a symbol of greed, jealousy, and possessiveness. BLUE - is typically a symbol of depth, stability, wisdom, faith, truth, and heaven. The negative side can be coldness, uncaring, and sadness.

21,https://alicebordignon.github.io/ITArtHistorians/index.html,text,conclusion,,,,"General conclusions. 1. What is the distribution in the Italian territory of the keepers? Many charts belonging to the Database Overview section of queries provide us with an answer to the first research question: General predominance of the North of Italy. Our dataset seems to give keepers and cities in the North of Italy a position of predominance as they preserve more historians' collections. Even the historians who were born or died in the North of Italy seems to be much more represented than the historians coming from the South. In fact, our dataset strongly lacks historians who were born or died in the South of Italy. From one hand, it could be legible that cities with an active tradition of artists and historians such as Rome and Florence have a predominant position, but on the other hand, it cannot be denied that also cities like Naples and Palermo were important cultural spots in the past. Thus, it is unjustified that these cities are so underrepresented in our dataset. Furthermore, this is a huge problem for contemporary historians of art history who want to focus on the South of Italy as our dataset is not that helpful for them. Geographical fragmentation of keepers. We can notice that besides institutions like Scuola Normale Superiore and Fondazione Federico Zeri most of the keepers conserve only one art historian’s collection. As a result, in Italy, the conservation of the cultural heritage left by art historians is very fragmented in the territory, without the presence of a strong central institution. To conclude, the overral view of our dataset testifies how the Italian keepers are many and disseminated in the territory with few and all North and Central-baser important cities such as Florence, Rome and Bologna. Possible developments: are we talking about discrimination? Further developments are needed to have a better understanding of the phenomenon. In the meanwhile, we wondered some questions from which it would be interesting to go on: Can it be that in the South of Italy were born fewer art historians? Can it be that the collections of art historians coming from the South of Italy are not recorded online? Can it be that there are fewer archives or collections left by Southern historians? To return to the interactive chart, click here. 2: What is the role and the consequences of the digital technologies with respect to the Italian archival world? Many of the charts belonging to the Historians and Keepers group of queries are useful to answer this research question: Only one digital library among all keepers. Starting from our dataset, it seems that in Italy there is only a single digital library in charge of conserving art historians' collections: the BEIC Digital Library, based in Milan. The BEIC digital library conserves the highest number of historians' collections (10) and Milan is the main city that own more historians who neither were born or died there. The digital paradigm VS the physical paradigm. The data obtained lead us to reflect on the differences between the digital and the physical paradigm: Where there is no digital keeper, the historians' collection are likely conserved in the same physical place where the historian either died or was born. Thus, the physical birthplace or deathplace plays a crucial role in deciding which keeper will own the collection. In particular, the results show how the place where a historian died is the more relevant aspect to consider with regard to the keeper's location. The digital paradigm, instead, works differently breaking the physical limits. Indeed, it does not matter where the historian died or was born because their collection will be conserved by digital keepers which can have physical headquarters elsewhere. Starting from our results, we can suppose that the Italian archival world is more rooted to the physical keepers than the digital ones to preserve the cultural heritage left by historians.. 3: Is there a correlation between the kind of the keepers and the historians they conserve? Finally, the charts belonging to the Keepers instances and temporal analysis are the most appropriate to explain the following general conclusions: A possible correlation could be found. Even though further analysis should be done to have a sharped comprehension, the results seem to suggest that there could be a correlation between the kind of keeper and the historian's collection conserved. Libraries and archives seem to follow the physical paradigm according to which they conserve historians who either were born or died in the place where the keeper is located. The most frequent keepers for historians who neither were born nor died in their places are less conventional types of keepers such as open-access publishers, digital libraries or websites. Libraries and archives are dominant in preserving the cultural heritage of historians who were born in the 1400 and 1500. Universities seem to preserve more collections of historians who were born between 1800 and 1900. Open-Access Publishers seem to preserve more collections of historians who were born between 1600 and, especially, 1900.",,,,,,,,0,

Photography has certainly represented the opening of new horizons, contributing to the emancipation of women. Hence, the slogan ""A camera of one’s own"" wants to emphasize the role of the camera as the generator of new visions, entirely female, of the world. Just as Virginia Woolf needed a room of her own to write, women photographers with their personal cameras witness a scenario in constant change that sees them more involved and independent. The research underlines the role of photography in enhancing women's emancipation.

Among the pioneers, there are many scholars of science who use photography to inventory their discoveries, such as Anna Atkins, a botany creator of cyanotypes that reproduce the contours of plants; as well as there are photographers who lead a double life, such as Edith Tudor-Hart, an established photographer of Austrian origin who becomes a spy for the KGB in the 1930s. In the middle of the 20th century, women used photography to take a stand and assert their personal gaze. Holding high the flag of the engaged photograph, they participate in multiple armed battles of their apparatus, from the Resistance to feminism. One example is the French photographer Janine Niépce, who studied art history in Paris during the Second World War and worked on some films about the Resistance. He then became a reporter and witnessed the events of May ‘68 and the Women’s Liberation Movement throughout the 1970s. In the second half of the 20th century, the world of photography always focused on the West, is now globalized and giving rise to the progressive recognition of photographers from other continents as can be seen from the presence of women operating in India, South Korea or Madagascar. The boundaries between photography, film, performance and installation are increasingly blurred. There are many authors who, in the course of their projects, pass from one practice to another. Malala Andrialavidrazana, born in 1971 in Madagascar, after studying architecture in Paris, in the 90s takes an anthropological approach to photograph funeral customs and Malagasy commemorative rites. Between intimate exploration and sociological portrait, Malala overturns exotic stereotypes and so she is fully entitled under the label of visual and visionary artist.",,,,,,,,0,

As early as 1913, in an article titled “Photography As a Profession for Women”, Imogen Cunningham had taken a clear stance: “Photography is not a better profession for a woman or for a man, it is simply a profession.” Later, she would elaborate on her point of view: “I am a photographer, not a woman.

In Asia the most represented state is Japan, in South America are Mexico and Argentina, while in Africa we find Algeria, Togo, South Africa and Madagascar. Until the 1950s it was still the West, in particular Germany and the United States, to guide the technological development of photography: Zeiss, Kodak, Leica, Contax and Rollei are just some of the authoritative names that we can list in this regard. In 1959, however, the arrival on the market of the Nikon F brought with it a series of substantial innovations and was about to become the professional camera par excellence. The role of Japan has changed since that moment. Thinking about Mexico, Tina Modotti comes in mind. Tina was an Italian artist who emigrated to the United States and then moved to Mexico together with the photographer and her lover Edward Wetson. Tina Modotti joined the Mexican Communist Party and began to document her country of adoption, with a particular interest in female figures, folklore and religious art. ",,,,,,,,0,

22,https://gravazzini.github.io/womenlens/,text,conclusion,,,,"Main findings. Architecture, Sculpture. The relationship between photography and architecture dates back to the invention of photograph. Indeed, the first photographic image was that of an architectural space, the courtyard of the Maison du Gras, the family home of Nicéphore Niepce in Saint-PierreLoup-de-Varennes, near Chalon-sur-Saône (1827). The consistent relationship between the two arts is also demonstrated by the fact that several photographers have favored as the object of their works architectural elements, such as Berenice Abbott, who grew up in the artistic environments of New York in the early decades of 1900, which documents and testifies the coexistence of old and new buildings within the project entitled Changing New York. The relationship of the architects with photography is also ancient and dates back to the pioneering period of the history of photography. One of the pioneers was Lotte Beese, born in Germany, who enrolled in the Bauhaus school specializing in textile design and then in architecture, at a time when this profession was still considered traditionally male. Visual Art. Between the 50s and 70s we find several painters-photographers. These are years of great changes, of post-war recollection and of democratic openness to the future after the dark dictatorial pages. Women have also paved the way for affirmation in the field of the arts, thanks to feminist struggles, and they begin to question the very representation of women in their works. Among these visionary photographers, we find Ouka Leele, born in Spain and an exponent of the ""Movida"", an artistic movement of liberation that was born after the death of Franco. Ouka’s works are born in black and white and are then painted before being photographed again. It is a particular and unique technique that mixes together photography and painting. Literature. “The cheapness of writing paper is, of course, the reason why women have succeeded as writers before in other professions. Writing was an honorable and harmless occupation. Domestic peace was not disturbed by the crunch of a nib; the familiar balance was not aggravated”. These are the words said by Virginia Wolf speaking at a conference held at the London Society for Women’s Service in 1931.It is interesting to stop and reflect how the profession of writing has always been more akin to the female sphere and therefore less disruptive than female photography. Eudora Welty is a perfect example of a writer-photographer. She is an exponent of contemporary American literature and she investigates the racial and cultural problems of the United States of the South, documenting the Mississippi region, the difficulties of workers during the Great Depression and African-American communities. His work as a photographer is characterized by great empathy and resonates with the characters and themes addressed in his books. Cinema, Music, Theatre. Within the performing arts, there is a proliferation of actresses, singers, dancers and directors. Interestingly, the most widespread profession in this field is that of film director. Women photographers place their critical gaze on the world not only through the lens of the camera, but also through that of the movie camera. One example is Helen Levitt, born in Brooklyn in 1913, who became famous for street photographs taken in New York in the late 30s, she directs several documentaries and works in cinema until the 60s. Media Art. Among the media arts, which includes photography itself, there are three subcategories of the work as a photographer: the photojournalist, the photographer of fashion and of war. In fact, there are many photojournalists at the turn of the two wars and in particular in the Second World War to witness the atrocities of some of the darkest pages of history. Some of them even embrace both fashion and war photography, as if they wanted to show that women can carve out a space and have their own vision in situations that are anything but frivolous. One example is Lee Miller, who began his career as a model for Vogue in New York in 1927 and then moved to London and began working as a fashion photographer for British Vogue in 1939. Later, in 1942, she was credited as a war correspondent for the same magazine and documented the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. On that very day, in the evening, he is in Munich and gets caught in the bathtub of Adolf Hitler’s apartment. ""I took some photos of the place and I even had a good night’s sleep in Hitler’s bed.

It should not be forgotten, in fact, as emerged from the second research topic, that more than double the number of photographers examined in the dataset is of American origin. However, in the United States there are no photographers sculptors, present both in France and in Germany; while the profession of screenwriter is present only in the United States if we consider these four countries. If we enlarge the view to the entire dataset, another figure of woman screenwriter photographer will emerge unexpectedly: Shirin Neshat.

The profession of photojournalist and journalist is more widespread in the United States, while that of painter in Germany. If we consider the German cultural scenario, we cannot fail to refer to the Bauhaus, a school of art and design in which many German female photographers gravitated by taking courses in painting and industrial desgin initially precluded to women. France, compared to the other selected countries, has a greater number of sculptors, visual artists and models. It is no coincidence that France historically is the cradle of the main fashion houses in the world and consequently the modeling profession is more widespread there than in other countries.

23,https://dbrembilla.github.io/redditholes/,text,introduction,,,,"What is reddit? Reddit is a social media platform organised in communities rather than individual connections. This makes the experience on the platform quite different from other Social Networks and closer, in a way, to the one of forums in Web 1.0. Users (u_myusername) can take part in subreddits (r/mysubredditname) where topics are discussed and partecipation takes place in the form of either posting or up/downvoting posts and comments from others. The total value of upvotes and downvotes can be quantified as the total karma of a post, comment or user. Who are users? A user (also called redditor) can make posts. Posts (also called submissions) can be links, videos, pictures, polls or text. The OP (Original Poster) as well as other users can comment and vote the post if they find it interesting. Users can also give posts awards by paying for Reddit coins; these recognize other people's contributions. There are hundreds of these, from a generic gold or silver award to others following internet lingo and memes, such as the “F” award (used ironically to ‘pay respect’). Users can mark their posts with multiple types of flairs such as OC (Original Content), Spoilers, +18 and so on. Users can be humans or bots. Bots represent an important part of the Reddit experience, with roles from moderation, to engaging with users by quoting movies or books, waving flags to other utilities and fun uses. What are communities? Reddit is structured in subreddits, communities that users can join. Subreddits' themes can vary from cute pets, to political parties, to recipe advice. A subreddit are usually referred to as “r/” followed by its name (in our case, we will start our study from “r/conspiracy”). Subreddits present multiple difference and can also have interesting mechanics. Subreddits can have different levels of moderation and bot acceptance, various tone to posts (from moderate to sarcastic to aggressive), all depending from the nature of the subreddit. Subreddits may also have rules: some subreddits require mandatory flairing, some require the link of sources, some have no rules at all (as in the case of conspiracy). This ambiguity makes Reddit a more decentralised and open Social Network in which some of the (inefficient) cut down on fake news and trolls that happened on sites such as Facebook or Twitter has not happened (at least at the same level) yet. Given this, we already had some extreme subreddits that were closed, while some controversial communities can still be found. You can find a Wikipedia article here about those. Who is the average redditor? Reddit users, according to data from the site itself, are more than 50 million with more than 100 thousand communities. They are mostly male (56%) and are between 18 and 34 year old (58%). They are from the US and English speaking countries, with significant communities from Germany and India. What kind of mechanics influence communication on Reddit? The community-centric nature of Reddit makes for an ideal place for the birth of Echo Chambers and Rabbit Holes. The expression ""Echo Chamber"" refers to situations in which personal beliefs and opinions are amplified by communication and repetition inside a closed information system, insulated from any possible disagreement. By participating in an Echo Chamber, people are insulated from opposite opinions, resulting in a classic example of confirmation bias. Because of this, Echo Chambers increase social and political polarization and extremism. Going down the Rabbit Hole is a metaphor to indicate that a person is caught up in intense topic research phase that includes going from subject to subject, deeper and deeper, leading to the creation of an often weird and seemingly unrelated belief system (this video shows it very clearly). The metaphor comes from Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, in which Alice begins an adventure by following the White Rabbit into his burrow. An example of the strong affiliation between users and subreddits is the level of competition, and sometimes hatred, between them. We see this in the political sphere, where one can find subreddits dedicated to Bernie Sanders and subreddits going against them. Another can be found in the r/place subreddit, an event-connected subreddit (it was opened, before 2022, in 2017) in which each user could place a pixel in a canvas every 5 minutes, requiring coordination between users to create a bigger picture, resulting in 'wars' for space between subreddits.

This section is dedicated to the networks of subreddits we found in our research. These were found by investigating the posts shared by subreddits (e.g. a link to a news is shared between them, an image in common...), starting from r/conspiracy. We did this by employing Network Analysis tools (Gephi). The more the posts in common, the stronger the connection is. In particular, these networks were found by means of modularity (the cohesion of the network's communities). We also observed the comment section's behavior through a Sentiment Analysis and a Topic Modelling. Sentiment Analysis returns whether the words in a comment are negative or positive (e.g. swear words make a comment negative), while Topic Modelling uses Deep Learning to find abstract topics in the texts. There may be lacking information / absence of some subreddits from comments-related data; that is because it often happens that there are no comments in crossposts, as a post was already seen in a more popular subreddit.",,,,,,,,0,

The presence of communities related to the market speculation and crypto on Reddit is not only well known but also caused some of the economical freezes of the last years, including the Gamestop short squeeze in January 2021. This network is also tightly connected to Political and news subreddits, along with generalist subreddits such as r/Pics and subreddit about recent events, for instance r/Blackout2015, which could be functioning as bridges between news and misinformation. This created a connection between otherwise news oriented subreddits and mostly delusional ones.","I love news and Reddit.

23,https://dbrembilla.github.io/redditholes/,chart section,,card,image,flip,"Reddit is a community based Social Network. The subreddit community structure allows and facilitates the creation of Echo Chambers. People sharing similar ideas and interests are facilitated to group together, reinforcing the human tendency to look for similar individuals. These communities therefore become the perfect environment to foster reciprocal confirmation bias. Reddit's moderation is often devolved to users. The fact that communities have the right to moderate (or not) themselves makes Reddit less punishing compared to other social networks, with a less restrictive control from the top. This allows for all kind of (mis)information to spread freely in the communities, allowing for otherwise censored contents to find their place on the platform. Reddit's structure is prone to the creation of Rabbit Holes. Rabbit holes happen when a user is caught up in social media content, starting from one and following further branches with the theoretically infinite search, due to the huge quantities of content. Since each user is able to see the posts from the communities they are following, it is really easy to find more and more contents related to one another, in the form of posted materials from other subreddits. One could therefore theoretically keep jumping from post to post, without ever going back to their past trail, and getting caught up more and more in their starting topics or collateral ones. Reddit has a publicly accessible API that can be used to post and retrieve information. The ease to access large amounts of information regarding the contents shared on the platform made it a good candidate for our study. We were able to analyze Reddit's contents through the use of PRAW, a Python library that allows to access the plaform API. The only requirements to use it are a Reddit profile and the creation of an app (which grants the developer with a secret key to query the API with). Reddit's has recently been growing in popularity within the social studies community. The attention of academics from social sciences, along with computer sciences, communication studies and similar has been drown to this platform because of its ease of consulting, users freedom of speech, self regulation and the vastness and variety of its contents, but a lot is still left to be investigated. In this context it is interesting to approach the dynamics of reddit, as much as the ones it shares with canonical social medias, under the lenses of Digital Humanities. Reddit posseses a unique and varied user base. It started out as a ""nerd-based"" community, but now it incorporates a wide variety of contents, from finance, to computer science, to politics and news. There are probably a dedicated subreddit to any topic you can find (a personal favorite of ours: parasnailing, a subreddit about snails who... parachute?). Another interesting point was the variety of actions that communities take outside the platform. One example of this is ""r/WallStreetBets"" guiding the Gamestop short squeeze in January 2021.",Why reddit? “Be what you would seem to be”,,,,6.0,no,Reddit,1,card
23,https://dbrembilla.github.io/redditholes/,text,research question,,,,"Our thesis. Rabbit Holes and Echo Chambers are processes that can be observed on Reddit. This shows that the platform, even if the ""suggestion logic"" that governs other social media platforms (e.g. Youtube) is less manifested, it is not safe and sound in the least. Communities tend to form around topics and ideologies, reproducing something more similar to the basic human need to find assurance and stable truths to base their behavior on (e.g. confirmation bias or selective perception). Rabbit Holes and Echo Chambers can create more cohesive subcommunities around various topics. By analyzing the structure of the network formed by subreddits as nodes and connected by crossposts it will be possible to highlight, using analytical tools such as Network Analysis, overarching communities. These communities should represent real thematic conglomerates of subreddits. This does not mean that there are strongly interrelated subreddits with just one point of interest but wider and multifaceted connections constructed thanks to social, political and ideological connections (e.g subreddits related to extreme left and subreddits related to veganism, which has been, in the last years linked to strong political actions and political movements such as PETA). Users approach radicalized contents through gateways communities that can lead from moderate and socially acceptable contents to more radicalized ones. Users participate to discussions in subreddits communities and often connect them with one another through crossposting of contents. This allows for radicalized contents to reach new users, through users interaction, connecting them to less moderate communities. It is also possible to observe, through the analysis of contents, how sectorized subreddits, participating in smaller communities, connect to wider ones through gateways consisting in subreddits grouping linked topics in the same environment. An evidence of radicalization may also appear from the tone of conversation. As social media allows for free expression of hatred, we expect most comments in radicalized communities to be negative.",,,,,,,,0,
23,https://dbrembilla.github.io/redditholes/,text,data preparation,,,,"Our method. Identification and extraction of connections between subreddits. You can follow our methods in our Jupyter Notebook. What we needed to start our analysis was to identify a starting subreddit and then expand its connections and examine them. Our starting point was r/conspiracy in order to be sure to include at least one conspirational subreddit in the analysis. We then decided to consider the top 5000 posts from the subreddit, extract their url and query the whole Reddit to search for posts sharing their URL, through PRAW. We were then able to obtain the subreddits r/conspiracy was most connected with, at least in terms of shared contents, and save them in a CSV file: this consisted in our network's first level, containing the resharing's location, their link and their number. We then proceeded to expand this first level into the second one applying the exact same logic to each of the subnetwork identified in the CSV: this generated a list of CSV files, each corresponding to the resharings subreddits relative to the first 5000 top posts of its naming subreddit. For the first level we randomly selected 10 of this CSVs and performed the same task, but this time considering only the first 500 top posts. Network construction and identification of communities. With this data we were able to extract the information needed to construct our network of subreddits, considering each of them as a node, weighted by the amount of connections possessed, while edges were identified as crossposts between nodes and weighted by the number of actual crossposts present, which was one of the information previously memorized in the CSV files. The network was then subdivided in communities through the application of Modularity measures and the communities were separated before submitting the network to a ForceAtlas algorithm to allow the observation of more and less central communities. This also allowed us to identify groups of communities sharing connections and sub-group the whole networks in such aggregated subnetworks, along with the single ones previously highlighted. Comment extraction: Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling and Wordclouds. The last step consisted in extracting each posts' comments, considering also the first level of replies to each comment, and save them in order to access them later for analysis. This was done both at a single subnetwork level than at a grouped-subnetwork one. Comments were then submitted to Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modelling: the first one is a methodology employing supervised machine learning able to identify affective states and subjective information, while the latter is a statistical method used to discover recurring topics in a collection of texts. Vader lexicon was chosen for both processes in order not to underestimate social networks slangs and typical expressions. Also wordclouds were computed from comments through the use of WordCloud.",,,,,,,,0,
23,https://dbrembilla.github.io/redditholes/,text,conclusion,,,,"Results. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it”.  Smaller communities share viewpoints, but have similar posts to bigger ones. It's not just communities with similar viewpoints that have the same posts. Often times, there are similar shared posts in communities with little to do with one another, but the closest communities share the same posts, suggesting an Echo Chamber formation. It is possible to trace some social movements through the posts. The Bernie campaign for 2020 can be traced in the plethora of subreddits dedicated to him. The same can be said about the Canadian Freedom Convoy. Reddit bots are everywhere! They significantly impact the comment section of any post, as well as propagate crossposts. The conspiratorial part of Reddit has multiple forms. There is not just a single, coherent, conspiratorial part of Reddit, rather a multiheaded perspective. There is a small number of subreddit that unify the expansion of news There is usually a number of subreddits that forms the backbone of news sharing, around which other communities seem to form. It did not take long to go from r/conspiracy to r/pics. Reddit is huge, but the steps to go from one place to another is small. It is very easy to end up in an Echo Chamber of subreddits sharing the same views. What can you do? “No, I’ll look first, and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not.” Is Reddit the only social network prone to Echo Chambers and Rabbit Holes? Echo Chambers can be found in any Social Media, as they are a result of both social networks' algorithms that suggest new content based on what they calculate will attract most attention to the user, as well as the formation of insulated communities. As an example, echo chambers are well-documented on Facebook. If echo chambers are due to social networks algorithms, how can we avoid them? This is difficult to say. While personal responsibility cannot be the solution to this, one should always remember that social media are not representative of the general population; what we see is the result of decisions made to maximise our attention. A better solution would be the intervention of legislators, who should ask for transparency to social media companies. How can you find out if you end up in a rabbit hole? A solution could be to do a step back and really ask yourself: is this information reliable? Is this really what I believe or do I just happen to be shown all this, thus becoming accustomed to this information? What was my original curiosity? Are there similar issues realted to personal networks or is this specific for online interactions? One naturally tends to be around people with similar ideas and information, and people who are close to us tend to shape our ideas. This also happens through old media, but online interactions excacerbate this behavior. What is the consequence of ending up in an Echo Chamber? Does it make me one of the bad guys? It is very much human to fall into an Echo Chamber. Being aware of ones' biases and of being in an Echo Chamber is the first step to 'breath fresh air' and see what really is 'Through the Looking Glass'. What if I like to be in an Echo Chamber? Well, we cannot control you- we wanted you just to be aware of the context you are in.",,,,,,,,0,

I made myself so beautiful, to attract the eyes of all the men who could see me. But my goal was only Holofernes. I bravely passed through the doors with only my maid for company, was captured by a Babylonian patrol and taken to their camp. I remember how Holofernes was deeply impressed and invited me to stay. I had to wait three long days before the general acted as I wanted. I tried to convince him that I could have the revelation of the sins of my people so that God would give it into their hands him. I was relieved to see how Holofernes himself took advantage of the banquet to seduce me, the plan continued in the right way! To my immense good fortune, when I entered Holofernes' room he was already hopelessly drunk. It was the perfect opportunity to kill him! I approached his bed, I could feel my heartbeat accelerating but no thought distracted me from my goal.

What story is hidden behind? Rarer is to wonder how many places it has passed through to get here . In how many parts of the world has it been to? What are the traces it had left in its passages? What is the memoir of its journey? Broad and popular is the view that artworks have been, are and will always be in the place where we have connected them, as a milestone in history. What would be your reaction if the Mona Lisa was moved from the Louvre, an ensign for the museum (if not for the entire country!), when the impression that it has never been away from there is so wide? In reality though, Leonardo's masterpiece landed in the Louvre only during the period of the French Revolution, while before it had been sold to King Francis I for 4,000 gold coins. Even after the acquiring from the Louvre, it had been missing for two years, and when found, had travelled to Tokyo, Moscow, Washington, and New York . It is not the only work of art having had such an adventurous journey. Each creation has a story to recount about travels in places and time. All these journeys leave marks and traces on the way, imprinted in the mindful lands of archives, catalogues and collections.

The Artchive contains data about art historian such as Italian, European, American, as well as data from some of the archival collections that they created.These collections contain information on what art historians have studied over the course of their lives (research notes, photographs, correspondences) allowing us to understand, which historical periods, subject or specific aspect of the Renaissance was studied",,,,,,,,0,

Art works: Mona Lisa, David of Michelangelo, The last supper. he Renaissance has always been a very popular and appealing time period to study for art historians. This popularity brings to mind who were these art historians, when did they do the most work, did they study any other works other than the Renaissance, what were they, and more importantly, where is the best place to obtain this research information. It has become apparent that the Renaissance was not always a favourite topic of research by art historians. There has been a decline in interest by the art historian of the Renaissance period, and in fact, at certain points of time, there were other artistic periods, and other aspects, such as focusing primarily on research of an artist, that captured the interest of art historians as well. Research into Renaissance art has become an unpopular choice for art historians in our current time. We want art historians to understand the importance of continuing their work of this rich period of history. If the interest by art historians declines to non-existence in Renaissance art, our society runs of risk of losing one of the most valuable periods of artwork in our world history. Suddenly without any interest, the works become devalued and unimportant, and in turn, we do not place any importance on the conservation and protection of these important pieces of history. There is still so much information out there that art historians could glean that has not been uncovered. For example, what is it about the interest in the Renaissance art that caused it to diminish in the 2020 decade, why were the art historians predominantly male, and why was the time period from 1950 to approximately 1980 showing the highest number of art historians researching the Renaissance. Further research needs to be done.",,,,,,,,0,

The findings show that during the 1950s to the 1980s there was a consistent strong average number of art historians doing research on the Renaissance art. As the twenty-first century approached, there was a significant drop in the average number of art historians. Question 2. Other artistic periods had been studied along with the Renaissance by art historians. The data showed that the Baroque and 15th and 16th centuries were the most common artistic periods that were also researched at the same time. Question 3. The findings also showed that the majority of art historians of the Renaissance period did their research by focusing on one artist, For example: Leonardo da Vinci, as opposed to artifacts or different genres of the entire Renaissance period. The least popular was studying the Renaissance period by the artifacts themselves, such as buildings and artwork. Question 4. With this question the focus switches on the material objects which represent the study of the Renaissance period. The archives contain different objects, some of them are pretty common, and some other really rare. But all of them, summed and compared, can tell us something about a concrete aspect of a discipline funded on interpretations and research.

In particular it enhances not only the overall trend but also the picks and the falls of the art historians interests. The first sight about the data is in a year by year trend, where data show that the average number of art-historians, in the beginning, is relatively low, starting from the mean of 1 in the 1880s. However, with the passage of time the average number of enthusiastic art-historians has increased and it reached a peak in the 1950s, from when this number grew somewhat steadily until the 1980s. As it's shown in the graph the average number of art-historians started to decrease in the last decades of the XX century and the first ones of the XXI century. Overall, we can see a clear downward trend in the number of art-historians interested in Renaissance, in a way that allows to say that the study of Renaissance is not popular anymore",First Question,Development of renaissance over time,descriptive,,140.0,no,ARTchives;Wikidata;WordlCat Identities,0,line
